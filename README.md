# node-chat-site
This repository contains the basic code for a multiple-way chat site. 

In this code, we're creating a new Express application and a new HTTP server using the http module. 
We're also creating a new Socket.IO instance and attaching it to the HTTP server. 
Finally, we're setting up a basic route for the root URL (/) that serves an HTML file called index.html

to run the files, start by entering "node index.js" into your terminal.
You can then go to http://localhost:3000 to see the result.
